# Face Detection 

This program is developed in **Juypter Notebook**, using two different algorithms; **Haar Cascade** and **Deep Neural Network**. Both of the programs have the feature to capture the faces upon clicking the button 'X' on the keyboard. The clicked picture will be saved as a png file in the program folder.
